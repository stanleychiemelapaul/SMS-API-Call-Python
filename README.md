# SMS API Call Python Template

This template provides a basic setup for making SMS API calls in Python. Ensure you replace the database configuration with your correct setup.

## Usage

1. **Database Configuration:**
   - Ensure you update the `db_config` variable with your database connection details.

2. **API Configuration:**
   - Replace the placeholders in the `api_config` dictionary with your API host, endpoint, and credentials.

3. **Sending SMS:**
   - The `send_sms` function handles the API call to send an SMS.
   - Customize the message and recipient phone number as needed.

4. **Processing Bulk SMS:**
   - The `process_bulk_sms` function retrieves clients from the database and sends SMS reminders.
   - Ensure the `BulkSMS` table and relevant columns (`Phone_Number`, `Next_visit_date`, `SMS_Status`) exist in your database.

## Code Example

```python
def send_sms(phone_number, message):
